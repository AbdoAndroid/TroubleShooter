<p>“Using iterative (instead of declarative) statements to<br>manipulate collections” — questionable. LINQ statements should only be<br>used for simple processing.

However, the article gives no clue how to choose<br>the correct collection. For small collections (a dozen of items) choose<br>whichever is easier to use, for large collections however (thousands and more)<br>you should carefully consider whether the collection should be ordered or no, and<br>which operations will prevail, only then choose based on the big O notation of<br>that operation.</p>

<p>“I saw the LINQ statement first and I totally got what it<br>was doing immediately” — it means you saw simple (by my standards) LINQ statements,<br>in the cases where the decision to use LINQ was wise. Which is not always the<br>case.</p><p>“descriptors like very hard are highly subjective”. Fine,<br>let’s lets about objective things. You cannot step in/step over, which becomes<br>problem e.g. if the LINQ contains non-MS extension methods — you can’t<br>just step in to find out what it does. You cannot use intermediate IDE window<br>with statements that have lambdas. Unlike imperative code, you can’t review<br>intermediate results as they’re not kept in variables but lost in the call stack.<br>Intermediate data is very often implicitly typed and unnamed. This list goes on<br>and on…</p><p>P.S. I saw a funny article entitled “What if Visual Studio<br>had Achievements?”. The relevant item is #2 that says “Job Security – Written a<br>LINQ query with over 30 lines of code”. In my previous comment, I was talking<br>about _that_ kind of LINQ.</p>

<p>I wish I could show you some of the LINQ I deal with at my work. 30+ 
lines of code, all within a methods return statement, utilizing 3-4 
ternary operators, also it's a double level LINQ call.</p><p>I love LINQ
 to interact with SQL in C#, but When it comes to arrays or lists, It's 
very rare it is more readable or more maintainable than a classic for 
loop.</p><p>I decided to put a snippet on pastebin for you: <a href="http://pastebin.com/0AauZVit" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/0AauZVit</a></p><p>The above code is what LINQ always ends up looking like, at best.</p>

<p>The problem with those snippets isn't Linq, the same thing as a 
foreach would be just as bad. The problem there is doing too much inside
 the object initialiser, which could just as easily do imperatively. If 
you were to replace the anonymous method with a more sensibly refactored
 equivalent, using Linq there would be fine.</p>

<p>RichardW1001 is right. Let one method do one thing. Return e.g. 
IEnumerable from that method and proceed. So it's perfectly testable as 
well. There is no problem with LINQ. For me it makes code MORE readable.</p>

<p>Yet you dismissed non-LINQ code just as easily. I think the point 
here is that the guideline should not be "write every query/loop as a 
LINQ if possible".</p><p>However, this article is superb not because I 
agree or disagree with everything, but it is superb if it makes people 
think about the code they're writing. Throwing gotchas in their face is a
 good idea.</p>

<p>Can you put a breakpoint in Linq? For example, if you have above

missing (because the status is "Active")</p><p>Secondly, what about performance? Doesn't Linq do the same iteration internally?</p><p>The

<p>My take from this list is wow, serious language design issues! 
structs passed by value, who thought it a smart idea to repurpose a well
 known keyword into something entirely different with many 
repercussions? LINQ is its own special little area of hell IMNSHO. Let's
 use an out of language tool to simulate a DB query on a collection and 
treat variables with a different ruleset. Sounds smart to me, no 
problems I can foresee. &lt;-- sarcasm… And lastly, to be able to assign
 an object as another and fail, with no exception? That's just asking 
for problems. Fortunately, my coding practices don't include any of 
these aberrations when I coded C#, but still, wow.</p>

<p>In our engineering section use of LINQ is rejected in code reviews,  
its viewed as unnecessary and just complicates code. Same applies to 
other unnecessary language additions. Making languages more complicated 
and code more terse to save a few keystrokes is plain stupid. Not just 
C# see the same thing in C++ and its slowly getting worse</p>

<p>Repurpose? Yes, structs in C# are rather different than in C or C++, 
but the fact that they are passed by value is not one of those 
differences.</p><p>And you can't simply assign an object as another and 
fail without exception (such as "myCat = myDog;"), you have to 
explicitly use the "as" keyword to do that ("myCat = myDog as Cat;"), 
something you'd only do in circumstances where null on failure to 
convert is the behavior you want, something common enough that it is a 
nice syntactical shortcut.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong....<br>1. Nice article !!<br>2. LINQ can be used in many places in a good and efficient way. Just think XML or trying to sort objects in a class.<br>3.
 Regarding #1 reference vs value, this is really problematic for 
programmers, because there is no intuitive way to know that if you pass a
 class (e.g. datarow) to another function it will work differently than 
if you pass an integer to that function. Of course one learns this 
quickly ;-)<br>And of course, C# is great, because it is so intuitive</p>

<p>There is another thing at #1, you can have an abstract class but not 
an abstract struct... So when you need copy-by-value sometimes there is 
no way around a class. But then you can implement a DeepCopy() function 
that performs a MemberwiseClone() in that class to get Values instead of
 References.</p>

<p>My personal favourite is #9. Never use catching as one of an intended
 paths in a workflow, do checks. Catching exceptions is a more complex

<p>While I agree with the caption of #9, I disagree about the message it sends.</p><p>If
 there is a valid execution path for all possible cases, you should NOT 
use exceptions. In a end user application, there should be checks to 
ensure the valid state of the application. A invalid CastException or 
similar should not happen. This makes it possible to reserve Exception 
only to real errors and not a valid program use case.</p>

<p>I don't think we disagree here. #9 was specifically intended to 
remind the programmer that the condition you started your sentence with 
("_if_ there is a valid execution path...") does not always hold. The 
point is to determine whether or not that condition holds, and choose 
the appropriate method, as opposed to automatically choosing the one 
that doesn't throw the exception.</p>

<p>Great read! I can confirm from own experience that #5, #9 and #10 are
 incredibly common among "senior" developers. #5 can happen to you if 
you don't understand how LINQ works, #9 can happen to you if you don't 
know what are exceptions and how it needs to be used in application (is 
there for reason and is not same as error), but #10 can only happen to a
 team where most people don't care at all about what they do. It makes 
me very sad when I see project with hundreds of warnings, it says a lot 
about general quality of code.</p>

<p>There are some good points in this article, but I disagree with the 
exception handling. Using "as" and "TryParse" should always be preferred
 when casting types, then the null's handled accordingly. The main 
reason for this is performance. Generating an exception is a very heavy 
operation, and whilst they should always be planned for and handled, if 
you can get away without using them, you should do so.</p>

<p>It's the "handled accordingly" part that's not always so 
straightforward. Sometimes the context you need to handle it accordingly
 is only available several frames up the stack. This is why exceptions 
were invented, to unwind the stack to that point. There is no reason to 
purposefully avoid using a language feature in a situation it was 
designed for.</p>

<p>Mistake #1 is using C#. The list of "advantages" of C# over C++ is 
bogus. C# is just as vulnerable, just as "complex" (whatever that 
means), and just as prone to errors (albeit of different nature) as C++.
 It makes a lot of things that are simple in C++ really hard (while the 
converse is less true). It is NOT cross-platform even within the MSFT 
ecosystem (and is even more hostile to cross-platform development if you
 consider non-Microsoft platforms). To date, C++ remains the best 
standard for cross-platform development. Finally, C# is much much much 
slower.</p><p>So why is there C#? Simple - it's the Miscrosoft answer to
 Java. They saw Java gain traction, felt threatened, and decided to push
 their own "standard" to lock developers in. Java itself was an attempt 
to break Microsoft hold on developers in the 90s. It all has to do with 
mega-monopolies, and NOTHING to do with better, easier development.</p>

<p>C# raises productivity by 5 to 10 times - thats a fact, in conjunction with a tool like ReSharper even more.</p><p>C++
 gives more flexibility, especialy by excessive usage of templates. But 
this leads to code that is hard to 'debug' - yee need to debug the 
compilation process. C++ isn't generally faster than C#, thats a myth - 
measurements (Image processing) show a different picture: C# gives the 
same or sligtly lower speed, BUT with much cleaner and more maintainable
 code. A simple Parallel.For is nearly on the same level as TBB based 
parallel processing.</p><p>Performance is not all, the performance 
crititical code is usually not more then 5...10 percent of an 
application. I made the best expirences with some (template flooded) 
native C++ code for hardware related / performance critical tasks, a 
managed C++ wrapper for it as a bridge and C# as the language for common
 application development.</p><p>Instead of this senseless  'Whats the 
best langunage' dicussions we should follow the rule: Use always the 
best suitable tool for a task. And combine them as figured about ealier.
 This gives you both, performance AND a short time to market.</p><p>Btw:
 Batch files/Shell scripts have a performance that is even worse 
compared to C++/C#, but are the glue in nearly every system...the right 
tool for the task.</p>

<p>You make some good points, esp. on having the right tool for the task. But I have to "raise an exception" with the following:</p><p>"C# raises productivity by 5 to 10 times - that's a fact"<br>"The Earth is 2 times cooler than it was 100 years ago - that's a fact"<br>"Smoking gives you healthy lungs - that's a fact"</p><p>You
 can "prove" each of these statements with selected data from selected 
industry sources. Who exactly is more productive with C#? Probably true 
for poorly-trained graduates of a 2-year technical program who have not 
been trained in C or C++. Developing a GUI for Windows? Probably true 
too, because MSFT has done their darnedest to push C# on developers and 
designed their libraries to that effect. The reason why your image 
processing application in C# is nearly as fast is probably because it 
uses an image processing library written in C :)</p><p>In general, more 
flexibility equates more productivity. Yes, it gives you more options to
 screw things up, but the answer to that is better training, not less 
flexibility. C# takes away a lot of useful tools that C++ offers to an 
experience developer, but the WORST is that it locks you on MSFT 
platforms. C++ was not designed to lock developers to platforms by 
business executives. (And don't even get me started on Java...)</p>

<p>Experienced developers would look at the problem's requirements and 
then choose a language that best suites the problem. You wouldn't use a 
fork over a spoon to eat tomato soup, both are eating utensils both 
solve the problem of getting food but the spoon is better suited to the 
problem at hand.</p><p>I use C# every day at work, I use python for 
quick web scripts etc. I use Scala for personal projects at home because
 I like being able to run java code libraries and Scala libraries 
interchangeably. Prolog, Haskell, lisp, lua, PHP, 
F#,go,FatherTime(points for whomever knows that one)... I could go on 
for days, each one has pros and cons pick one that solves the problem 
well and solves it in a simple (or as simple as possible) and easy to 
maintain manner.</p><p>"C# takes away a lot of useful tools that C++ offers", Really what might those be? don't say pointers <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y31yhkeb.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-u...</a>
 ,C# is Feature full and allows developers to solve the same problem in a
 style that suites them. I'm not saying C# Fixes everything just that it
 fits the bill for a lot of things.</p><p> "[C#] designed to lock 
developers to platforms" while this was made with windows in mind, it 
was not designed to limit to only one platform. "Microsoft first 
announced their .NET Framework in June 2000 it was described as "a new 
platform based on Internet standards",[23] and in December of that year 
the underlying Common Language Infrastructure was published as an open 
standard, "ECMA-335"  <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-335,%201st%20edition,%20December%202001.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecma-international....</a></p><p>There is even a large open source implementation of the .NET libraries that you may have heard of called mono.</p><p>All
 in all no one language rules them all a good Experienced developer uses
 the language as a tool for solving problems not just really good at 
using one tool and proclaiming it capable of doing most everything 
better than a tool that may actually fit the bill better.</p>

<p>Mono. Yeah. More bugs than a New York kitchen and slower than 
continental drift. If I wanted an environment hated and blocked by MSFT 
AAPL and GOOG equally I would definitely chose mono.</p><p>You clearly 
don't like pointers (even if all C# classes are implemented as pointers 
to objects under the hood). No problem, many IT trainees are not good 
enough to handle pointers.</p><p>Compared to Java of course, C# does not take much away from C++.</p><p>I
 stand by what I say. Instead of making more robust OS and adhering to 
common standards wrt APIs and libraries, the large software corporations
 are each pushing their own "language/environment" with the result that 
developers have to work x3 to publish cross-platform products. To make a
 soup analogy, the result is a mix of tomato soup, chocolate 
marshmallows, and clam chowder perfumed with skunk essence served in tin
 cans with proprietary locks.</p><p> It sucks. C++ is still the only way to write code once and easily run it across all the incompatible platforms out there.</p>

<p>Blocked? How so? (Also that depends on the Kitchen I like the imagery on that one)</p><p>I
 said nothing of hating pointers actually they make my life much easier.
 The pointers comment was merely pointing out that a lot of complaints 
about C# in C# vs C++ Say that C# doesn't have them in the same way C++ 
does, I fear that the link following that comment apparently did not 
clearly convey my implication, so let me make it explicit C# does have 
pointers and can be used much like C++ pointers.</p><p>Why compare to 
java, just leave it at C# does things C++ can't and C++ does things that
 C# can't. each have their place in this world, hence why they both 
still exist and have strong supporters like yourself.</p><p>I understand
 that Mono may not be fast but it does get the job done. I wouldn't want
 to write a real time raytracer on Mono but a simple application to do 
simple process x on all my machines... sure. I may use python just 
because I prefer, but it doesn't change the fact that I could do it in 
C#, or C++.</p><p>I hope I've shown C++ is not the only way but it is A 
way to things done. Not trying to cheapen C++'s value just sharing that 
it may not be the best choice for every endeavor, and hopefully someone 
will broaden their horizons  and try to learn a new language.</p>
